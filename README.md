# Data-Driven-Modeling-and-Prognostics-of-Battery-Degradation-Using R

This is the code part of my honors thesis from my undergraduate research, which invesitgated data-driven modeling and prognostics of battery degradation for RUL prediction. It uses a summarized dataset from CALCE containing battery degradation data. The code includes two machine learning models, one neural network regression and one Gaussian procress regression, as well as a linear mixed effects model. 

WARNING: The original data consisted of 309 Excel Workbooks, so I included the code for extracting the data, but not the data files themselves. I included the datasets from after I extracted the relevant information from the source files.
