# Data-Driven-Modeling-and-Prognostics-of-Battery-Degradation-Using R

This is the code part of my honors thesis from my undergraduate research, which invesitgated data-driven modeling and prognostics of battery degradation for RUL prediction. It uses a summarized dataset from CALCE containing battery degradation data. The code includes two machine learning models, one neural network regression and one Gaussian procress regression, as well as a linear mixed effects model.
