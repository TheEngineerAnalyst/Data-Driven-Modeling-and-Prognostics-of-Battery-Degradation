# Data-Driven-Modeling-and-Prognostics-of-Battery-Degradation-Using R

This is the code part of my honors thesis from my undergraduate research, which invesitgated data-driven modeling and prognostics of battery degradation for RUL prediction. It uses a summarized dataset from CALCE containing battery degradation data. The code includes two machine learning models, one neural network regression and one Gaussian procress regression, as well as a linear mixed effects model. For more information, feel free to look at my paper at https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00098298/00001/pdf.

WARNING: The original data consisted of 309 Excel Workbooks, so I included the code for extracting the data, but not the data files themselves. I included the datasets from after I extracted the relevant information from the source files. This is the link (https://calce.umd.edu/battery-accelerated-cycle-life-testing-data) to access the CALCE dataset, which is called "Periodical characterization data".
